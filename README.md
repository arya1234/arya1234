<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>

I'm an __MS in Data Science__ student at __Northeastern University Khoury College of Computer Sciences__. I have 4 years of experience building and deploying __machine learning__ and __deep learning__ models. Furthermore, I completed courses such as __Machine Learning Certification__ by __Stanford University__ and __Deep Learning Specialization__ by __Andrew Ng__. 

These courses were influential in my theoretical understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and data science. Later, I began to work on projects ranging from __pharmaceutical__, __agricultural__, __retail__, __manufacturing__ and __automobile__ industries. This portfolio is created to demonstrate a wide range of skills that I possess in solving and tackling machine learning problems. Thanks.üôÇ

<h2>ü™öüîß My Skills üòÄüòÄ:</h2>

I learned to code from a young age. I learned __"C"__ language and now I'm learning __python__ which gives me an edge in understanding machine learning and data science. As a result, I was able to learn and understand the code well. Later, I also learned various other programming languages such as __"R"__ which were important in order to become a __machine learning engineer__ or a __data scientist__. 

Below is a list of some of the skills that I've gained throughout my experience of working with data science and machine learning. Learning these important __tools__ and __techniques__ helped me build __machine learning projects__ and understand their work in full detail. Feel free to take a look.

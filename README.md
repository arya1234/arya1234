An independent __thinker__, __avid reader__ and __adventurous by nature__, aspiring to be an __Data Scientist__ after having achieved the necessary knowledge and skills to contribute them to real life problems faced by people around us and solve them using __Data Driven Decision__ making skills.


<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>

Currently an __MS in Data Science__ student at __Northeastern University Khoury College of Computer Sciences__, having 2 years of experience building and deploying __machine learning__ and __deep learning__ models. Furthermore, I have certifications such as [`RHCE`](https://rhtapps.redhat.com/verify?certId=210-118-394) by __RedHat__ and __Deep Learning Specialization__ by __Andrew Ng__. 

My theoretical grasp of machine learning, deep learning, and data science has been influenced by these courses. Later, I started working on initiatives related to __Manufacturing__, __Retail__, __Education__, __Financial__, and __Automotive__ industries. This webpage was made to showcase the broad variety of abilities I have when it comes to handling and solving machine learning issues.

<h2>ü™öüîß My Skills üòÑüòÑ:</h2>

My knowledge of the __"C++"__ programming language and my current study of __Python__ gives me an advantage when it comes to understanding the concepts and math behind machine learning and data science. I was able to learn, comprehend and produce the code as a result. Currently, I am learning additional programming languages like "R," which was necessary to become a "Machine Learning Engineer" or "Data Scientist."

Below is a list of some of the skills that I've gained throughout my experience of working with data science and machine learning. Learning these important __tools__ and __techniques__ helped me build __machine learning projects__ and understand their work in full detail. Feel free to take a look.
